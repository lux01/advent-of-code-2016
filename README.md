# Advent of Code 2016

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2016][aoc2016] Challenges.
To quote the _Advent of Code_ website:

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels.
> They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay
> sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon
> different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

Each day has two parts, the second part of which is available after successfully completing the first.

* [Day 1 - No Time for a Taxicab][day-01]: [Solution](day_01/) (Rust)
* [Day 2 - Bathroom Security][day-02]: [Solution](day_02/) (Rust)
* [Day 3 - Squares With Three Sides][day-03]: [Solution](day_03/) (Clojure)
* [Day 4 - Security Through Obscurity][day-04]: [Solution](day_04/) (Clojure)
* [Day 5 - How About a Nice Game of Chess?][day-05]: [Solution](day_05/) (Clojure)

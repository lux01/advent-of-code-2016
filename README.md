# Advent of Code 2016

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2016][aoc2016] Challenges.
To quote the _Advent of Code_ website:

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels.
> They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay
> sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon
> different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

Each day has two parts, the second part of which is available after successfully completing the first.
